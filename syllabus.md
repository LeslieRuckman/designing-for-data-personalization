Description
--------------------------------
The world is awash with new data, but how can designers take the next step to make this data more meaningful in people's day-to-day lives and interactions? Put differently, instead of giving people yet more data and visualizations to interpret, how can we personalize this data to provide simple insights that more intimately connect with what an individual really cares about?

In this class, we'll examine how personalized design can give people more meaningful and pleasant experiences with their data interactions. We'll explore how new technologies and designs are implementing these personalization strategies and how they're being successful (or not). We’ll learn how to model, generate, and store our own datasets; how to build our own APIs; and ultimately how to design meaningful applications and experiences around this data.

The course will have 3 main design challenges through which we will learn the above concepts:

1. **Making (Dry) Data Personal & Playful** - Personality and playfulness can go a long way in creating richer interactions around data. We’ll examine how to make seemingly 'boring' data interesting through design and personalization strategies.

2. **Designing for the Self** - It often helps to start by designing for our own problems. We'll explore how to track and design around a dataset of our own that we'd like to better understand. 

3. **Re-Contextualizing Everyday Data** - Given the sheer number of daily data interactions, there's so many opportunities to do it better. We'll explore how to take data we encounter everyday (the weather, food labels, subway delays) and re-contextualize it to give people more pleasant and smarter interactions.

Students will learn techniques on how to work with existing Web APIs, how to build and use their own Web APIs (with Node.js and Mongodb), and will implement user-facing designs utilizing p5.js and other Web technologies. Class examples will be presented in Javascript. Javascript tutorials will be assigned as a pre-requisite for those with little to no Javascript experience.

Grades
------

Grades will be determined according to the following breakdown:
- 3 Design Challenges: 50%
- Participation and Attendance: 25%
- Weekly Assignments: 15%
- Group Project: 10%

Class Blog
----------

It is expected that everyone in the class will create and maintain a blog for their assignments.

Email [slover@nyu.edu](slover@nyu.edu) with a link to you blog. I will add it to the class repo.

Listserv
--------

We will use a listserv both to have discussions outside of class, and for any technical help questions. Please email the listserv with all technical help questions (often, someone else will have a very similar question, or will at least find the answer useful).

Laptops
-------

This class covers numerous Web programming topics, and as a result, we will use laptops extensively throughout our class time. However, use of the computer outside of class topics (for example, chatting on Gmail or checking Facebook) is highly frowned upon and disrespectful. Repeated violators will be asked to leave the classroom. 

Weekly Assignments
------------------

We will have small weekly assignments that build on material presented in class. It is expected that you post all assignments to your blog, and come prepared to present your work (and respectfully engage with your peers when they are presenting).

Attendance
----------

Attendance is mandatory. Please inform me via email if you are going to miss a class. Habitually showing up late for class or an excessive number of absences will adversely affect your grade.

CLASS PARTICIPATION

As if I haven't said this enough. This class will be participatory, you are expected to participate in discussions and give feedback to other students both in class and participate with their projects. This (along with attendance) is 20% of your overall grade.

GROUP PROJECT

Starting on the 4th class, we will have weekly student projects. I will divide the class up into groups and each week one or two groups will give a 15 minute demonstration utilizing technology from the previous class (chat, audio streaming, video streaming and so on).

FINAL PROJECTS

Class will culminate final projects. It is expected that these will be both technology and content driven. Projects such as the development of a tool or a vehicle for live interaction will be considered but should be used in combination with content elements.

Javascript Resources
---------------------
For those who may not have prior experience with Javacsript, it is strongly recommended to do some outside video tutorials. The following are a list of suggested tutorials:

Client-side Javascript:
- [JS for Cats - Fun intro](http://jsforcats.com/)
- [CodeSchool - JS Road Trip Part 1 and Part 2](https://www.codeschool.com/paths/javascript)
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript)

Server-side Javascript
- [CodeSchool - Real-time Web with Node.js](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/real-time-web-with-node-js)
- [Nodeschool](http://nodeschool.io/)
- [MEAN (MongoDB Express.js AngularJS Node.js) tutorial - More Advanced](https://thinkster.io/mean-stack-tutorial/)
