Description
--------------------------------
The world is awash with new data, but how can designers take the next step to make this data more meaningful in people's day-to-day lives and interactions? Put differently, instead of giving people yet more data and visualizations to interpret, how can we personalize this data to provide simple insights that more intimately connect with what an individual really cares about?

In this class, we'll examine how personalized design can give people more meaningful and pleasant experiences with their data interactions. We'll explore how new technologies and designs are implementing these personalization strategies and how they're being successful (or not). We’ll learn how to model, generate, and store our own datasets; how to build our own APIs; and ultimately how to design meaningful applications and experiences around this data.

The course will have 3 main design challenges through which we will learn & practice the above concepts:

1. **Making (Dry) Data Personal & Playful** - Personality and playfulness can go a long way in creating richer interactions around data. We’ll examine how to make seemingly 'boring' data interesting through design and personalization strategies.

2. **Designing for the Self** - It often helps to start by designing for our own problems. We'll explore how to track and design around a dataset of our own that we'd like to better understand. 

3. **Re-Contextualizing Everyday Data** - Given the sheer number of daily data interactions, there's so many opportunities to do it better. We'll explore how to take data we encounter everyday (the weather, food labels, subway delays) and re-contextualize it to give people more pleasant and smarter interactions.

Students will learn techniques on how to work with existing Web APIs, how to build and use their own Web APIs (with Node.js and Mongodb), and will implement user-facing designs utilizing p5.js and other Web technologies. Class examples will be presented in Javascript. Javascript tutorials will be assigned as a pre-requisite for those with little to no Javascript experience.

Objectives
---------------------

By the end of the class, you should have a solid understanding of the following concepts:

- **Full-Stack Javascript** - Familiarity with both client-side and server-side Javascript.
- **Designing Data-Driven Applications**- How to design and build a 'full-stack' data application.
- **User-facing Web design concepts** - How to design and build user-facing interfaces that communicate data.
- **Designing Personalization Systems**- How to design and build systems that can collect user information and personalize data. 
- **Using APIs** - How to interact with and use an API from within your client application.
- **Designing, Structuring, & Storing Data** - How to build and store your own data.
- **Building APIs** - How to build your own APIs and make the data available to client applications.

Grades
------

Grades will be determined according to the following breakdown:
- 3 Design Challenges: 50%
- Participation and Attendance: 25%
- Weekly Assignments: 15%
- Group Project: 10%

Class Blog
----------

It is expected that everyone in the class will create and maintain a blog for their assignments.

Email slover@nyu.edu with a link to you blog. I will add it to a list here:

* Student Name - blogURl

Listserv
--------

We will use a listserv both to conduct discussions outside of class, and for any technical help questions. **Please email the listserv with all technical help questions (often, someone else will have a very similar question, or will at least find the answer informative).**

Laptops
-------

This class covers numerous Web programming topics, and as a result, we will use laptops extensively throughout class time. However, use of the computer outside of class topics (for example, chatting on Gmail or checking Facebook) is quite disrespectful and repeated violators will be asked to leave the classroom. 

Weekly Assignments
------------------

We will have small weekly assignments that build on material presented in class. It is expected that you post all assignments to your blog, and come prepared to talk about your work (and respectfully engage with your peers when they are presenting).

Attendance
----------

Attendance is mandatory. You must inform me via email if you are going to miss a class. Habitually showing up late for class or an excessive number of absences will adversely affect your grade.

Class Participation
-------------------

Class participation is a critical part of the class, and (along with attendance) makes up 25% of your final grade. We expect pro-active participation and feedback throughout class discussions and presentations. 

Group Projects
--------------

Starting on the 3rd class, we will have weekly group projects. I will divide the class up into groups and each week one or two groups will give a 15 minute demonstration. You can pick from 2 topics:

* **Design Presentation/Critique** - Pick a new or somewhat new technology (hardware, software or service) that relates to the overall topics in the class. 

    * Make a presentation that covers what the technology/service is, what is novel about it, how are people using it and so on.
    * What do you like about it? What would you do differently?
    * Notice their design decisions (user experience, interactions, etc.). What is effective? What is not?
    * Are there are any privacy concerns? Data Limitations?
    * Does it fulfill its promise? Where could you see it going in the future?    

* **Design Concept** - Pick a topic, dataset, or data-oriented user experience that you want to explore as a group.
    * How would you go about designing a product, service, application, experience, or installation that gives the world a better data interaction than what is available right now? 
    * Where does the user encounter this application or experience? 
    * Do you need to get any data from the user? How would you do that?
    * What are some key design decisions?
    * What is the key user interaction? How does it work technically?
    * Are there are any privacy concerns? Data Limitations? How would you overcome these?

It is up to you how to present it - a series of sketches, mockups, wireframes, or a basic prototype.

Design Challenges
-----------------

We will have 3 core design challenges through which you will get to develop and hone skills learned during the class. You will have ~3 weeks to do each design challenge. Presentations will occur on the following dates:

- **Class 5 (October 1)**: Making (Dry) Data Personal & Playful
- **Class 9 (October 29)**: Designing for the Self
- **Class 12 (November 19)**: Recontextualizng Everyday Data
