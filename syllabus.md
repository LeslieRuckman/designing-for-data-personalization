Description
--------------------------------
The world is awash with new data, but how can designers take the next step to make this data more meaningful in people's day-to-day lives and interactions? Put differently, instead of giving people yet more data and visualizations to interpret, how can we personalize this data to provide simple insights that more intimately connect with what an individual really cares about?

In this class, we'll examine how personalized design can give people more meaningful and pleasant experiences with their data interactions. We'll explore how new technologies and designs are implementing these personalization strategies and how they're being successful (or not). We’ll learn how to model, generate, and store our own datasets; how to build our own APIs; and ultimately how to design meaningful applications and experiences around this data.

The course will have 3 main design topics through which we will learn & practice the above concepts:

1. **Making Data Personal & Playful** - Personality and playfulness can go a long way in creating richer interactions around data. We’ll examine how to make data more interesting through design and personalization strategies.

2. **Designing for the Self** - It often helps to start by designing for our own problems. We'll explore how to track and design around datasets of our own that we'd like to better understand. 

3. **Re-Contextualizing Everyday Data** - Given the sheer number of daily data interactions, there's so many opportunities to do it better. We'll explore how to take data we encounter everyday (the weather, food labels, subway delays) and re-contextualize it to give people more pleasant and smarter interactions.

Students will learn techniques on how to work with existing Web APIs, how to build and use their own Web APIs (with Node.js and Mongodb), and will implement user-facing designs utilizing p5.js and other Web technologies. Class examples will be presented in Javascript. Javascript tutorials will be assigned as a pre-requisite for those with little to no Javascript experience.

Objectives
---------------------

By the end of the class, you should have a solid understanding of the following concepts:

- **Full-Stack Javascript** - Familiarity with both client-side and server-side Javascript.
- **Designing Data-Driven Applications**- How to design and build a 'full-stack' data application.
- **User-facing Web design & data visualization concepts** - How to design and build user-facing interfaces & visualizations that effectively communicate data.
- **Designing Personalization Systems**- How to design systems that can collect user information and personalize data. 
- **Using APIs** - How to interact with and use an API from within your client application.
- **Structuring Data** - How to intelligently structure data.

Listserv
--------

We will use a listserv both to conduct discussions outside of class, and for any technical help questions. **Please email the listserv with all technical help questions (often, someone else will have a very similar question, or will at least find the answer informative).**

Laptops
-------

This class covers numerous Web programming topics, and as a result, we will use laptops extensively throughout class time. However, use of the computer outside of class topics (for example, chatting on Gmail or checking Facebook) is quite disrespectful and repeated violators will be asked to leave the classroom. 

Weekly Assignments
------------------

We will have small weekly assignments that build on material presented in class. It is expected that you post all assignments to your blog, and come prepared to talk about your work (and respectfully engage with your peers when they are presenting).

Attendance
----------

Attendance is mandatory. You must inform me via email if you are going to miss a class. Habitually showing up late for class or an excessive number of absences will adversely affect your grade.

Class Participation
-------------------

Class participation is a critical part of the class, and (along with attendance) makes up 25% of your final grade. We expect pro-active participation and feedback throughout class discussions and presentations. 

Group Projects
--------------

Starting on the 3rd class, we will have weekly group projects. I will divide the class up into groups and each week one or two groups will give a 10-minute presentation. You can pick from 2 topics (although if you are really enthusiastic about doing something else, you may do that as well):

* **Design Presentation/Critique** - Pick a technology (hardware, software or service), project, or theme that relates to the overall topics in the class: designing around data; data personalization; data visualization of important topics; data tracking; physical data installations. 

    * Make a presentation that covers what the technology/service/project/theme is, what is novel about it, how are people using it and so on.
    * What do you like about it? What would you do differently?
    * Notice their design decisions (user experience, interactions, etc.). What is effective? What is not?
    * Are there are any privacy concerns? Data Limitations?
    * Does it fulfill its promise? Where could you see it going in the future?    

* **Design Concept** - Pick a topic, dataset, or data-oriented user experience that you want to explore as a group. 
    * How would you go about designing a product, service, application, experience, or installation that gives the world a different data interaction than what is available right now? 
    * Where does the user encounter this application or experience? 
    * Do you need to get any data from the user? How would you do that?
    * What are some key design decisions?
    * What do you hope the user gets from it?
    * What is the key user interaction? How does it work technically?
    * Are there are any privacy concerns? Data Limitations? How would you overcome these?

It is up to you how to present it - a series of sketches, mockups, wireframes, or a basic prototype.

Week 6
------
* **Student Presentations: Making Data Personal & Playful**

* **Assignment Week 6:**
    * In Weeks 7-9, we will be learning how to track and store our own data. In preparation, brainstorm 2-3 datasets that you are interested in tracking/collecting. **Post them to you blog**. 

    * Get set up for server-side node. Specifically, you **must** come to class with the following already done:

        1) Download node.js if you have not already <http://nodejs.org/>. You can confirm that node is successfully installed on your machine by opening up Terminal and typing 'node'. If you don't get an error, it's installed! You can exit the node process with Ctrl+c.

        2) Download and install the Heroku Toolbelt <https://toolbelt.heroku.com>, this will give you Foreman and the Heroku CLI (command line interface).

        3) Set up an account at <https://heroku.com>. You will be asked to enter a credit card, but the apps we are doing will not incur any charges (they just need a card on file). In fact, all Heroku apps have a starter/free level.

* **Assignment Week 7:**
    * Get the boilerplate up and running. Email the class list if you run into any issue. Please provide the exact error you are getting and the command you ran that gave you that error.
    * Requirements
        * [Download the boilerplate zip](https://github.com/sslover/node-express-api-boilerplate) (do not clone it!)
        * Read through the entire readme! Go step by step.
        * Add some data using [POSTMAN](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop/related?hl=en)
            * Remember that POSTMAN is just a tool for simulating HTTP requests (HTTP requests can originate from a browser, an Arduino Yun, a mobile app, etc. POSTMAN is just a tool for testing these requests.)
            * You will be posting to the /api/create route.
            * So, you will want to choose the POST option and then enter: http://localhost:3000/api/create
            * Choose the "Body" tab and then x-www-form-urlencoded
            * Enter key, value pairs. Look at the schema to see the data that is modeled. Examples:
                * name: Billy
                * tags: cute,black,puppy 
                * age: 8
            * (the tags example is a comma-separated list that will get made into an array.. this is a standard approach)
        * Once you have some data, play around with the other routes that are in index.js (you can go to GET routes in your browser, but need to make POST routes from POSTMAN):
            * http://localhost:3000/api/get
                * (GET route)
            * http://localhost:3000/api/get/:id
                * (GET route - copy and paste the id in place of :id... you can see the id in the response of http://localhost:3000/api/get)
            * http://localhost:3000/api/delete/:id
                * (GET route - copy and paste the id in place of :id... you can see the id in the response of http://localhost:3000/api/get)
            * http://localhost:3000/api/update/:id 
                * (POST route - use POSTMAN)
            * http://localhost:3000/api/create 
                * (POST route - use POSTMAN)
        * Once you are comfortable, push the app to the heroku app you created (see the repo... it's the part with git push heroku master)
        * NOW - Create your own schema (i.e. model your database in the models folder). See [Mongoose Schemas](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html) 
        * If you are comfortable, update the boilerplate to work with your own schema (i.e. change it away from the animal schema to the schema you have created)
        * You should have at least 5 routes, and they should be done in a RESTful style:
            1) Create
            2) Retrieve All
            3) Retrive One
            4) Update
            5) Delete
        * Use [POSTMAN](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop/related?hl=en) for POST requests

* **Assignment Week 9:**
    * This week, you must complete a fully working data app that has the following features:
        * Has your own data model
        * Has at least 5 routes:

            1) Create (via a form POST or via ajax POST)

            2) Retrieve One (by ID or some other parameter)

            3) Retrieve All

            4) Edit (via a form POST or via ajax POST)

    * This week, you must also come up with your final project proposal. This can cover any dataset you are interested in, and ideally should have both a back-end (storage/API) component and a front-end visualization component. However, if there is another type of project you are passionate about that strays from the above, you may also propose it (physical data viz, Web storytelling, etc.).

    * Prepare a 4-minute (max) presentation that covers the following:
        * The API you have created (show us the model and then the working data feed)
        * Tell us about your final project (1-2 slides)

**HOMEWORK - FINISH YOUR FINAL PROJECT**

For your final project, the following are requirements:

* **You must create a working project that you demo in class.**
* **The project should have 2 public links:**
    * Project demo
    * Github link 
        * If you've never pushed a repo to github. Here's the deal:
            * Sign in to your Github account
            * Click "New repository" in top right (the + sign)
            * Give it a name and description and click Create
            * Then, in terminal, enter the 2 commands in the 2nd box ("push an existing repository from the command line"). Or, if you've yet to start tracking it with Git, then go with the 1st box ("create a new repository on the command line")
            * Refresh the page and you'll see your repo
* **You must document it on your blog:**
    * What data did you decide to work with? Why were you interested in this data?
    * What were your key design considerations?
    * What are some of the key technology processes you used? What was interesting or tricky?
    * What are the key takeaways for yourself or for your target audience? What did you want them to get from your project?
    * Where else could you see this project going?
* **You must email me a link to the blog post, project demo, and github repo.**
