Designing for Data Personalization Syllabus
============================================
Overview
--------------------------------
The world is awash with new data, but how can designers take the next step to make this data more meaningful in people's day-to-day lives and interactions? Put differently, instead of giving people yet more data and visualizations to interpret, how can we personalize this data to provide simple insights that more intimately connect with what an individual really cares about?

In this class, we'll examine how personalized design can give people more meaningful and pleasant experiences with their data interactions. We'll explore how new technologies and designs are implementing these personalization strategies and how they're being successful (or not). We’ll learn how to model, generate, and store our own datasets; how to build our own APIs; and ultimately how to design meaningful applications and experiences around this data.

The course will have 3 main design challenges through which we will learn the above concepts:

1. Making (Dry) Data Personal & Playful - Personality and playfulness can go a long way in creating richer interactions around data. We’ll examine how to make seemingly 'boring' data interesting through design and personalization strategies.

2. Designing for the Self - It often helps to start by designing for our own problems. We'll explore how to track and design around a dataset of our own that we'd like to better understand. 

3. Re-Contextualizing Everyday Data - Given the sheer number of daily data interactions, there's so many opportunities to do it better. We'll explore how to take data we encounter everyday (the weather, food labels, subway delays) and re-contextualize it to give people more pleasant and smarter interactions.

Students will learn techniques on how to work with existing Web APIs, how to build and use their own Web APIs (with Node.js and Mongodb), and will implement user-facing designs utilizing p5.js and other Web technologies. Class examples will be presented in Javascript. Javascript tutorials will be assigned as a pre-requisite for those with little to no Javascript experience.

Javascript Resources
---------------------
For those who may not have experience with Javacsript, it is recommended to do some outside video tutorials. The following are a list of suggested tutorials:

Client-side Javascript:
- [CodeSchool - JS Road Trip Part 1 and Part 2](https://www.codeschool.com/paths/javascript)
- 

Server-side Javacsript
- [CodeSchool - Real-time Web with Node.js](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/real-time-web-with-node-js)


Week 1 -- Introduction, JS 101, JSON 101
----------------------------------------
- Intro to Designing for Data Personalization
- Design Exercise - get to know eachother via data collection
- Design Topic - Examples & Inspiration for the class
— Group Activities Overview
- Intro to servers, Web Development, and tools (POSTMAN, Sublime)
— HTML/CSS/JS 101 - a well-formed page and simple script 
— JSON 101 - rules & validation
- Assignment Week 1: 
    - This week, use an app that tries to personalize data (Poncho, Foursquare, Yummly). In your class blog, describe your interactions? What did you like about it? What bugged you? Did it live up to its promise of personalization?
    - Create a simple JSON file on a personal dataset that you care about.
    - Use JSON Lint to validate it.
    - Write a JS script that gets the above data and generates in it on a webpage
